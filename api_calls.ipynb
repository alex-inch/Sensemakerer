There will be further opportunities to pinch their medals at the Winter Olympics, which start next week, and at the World Cup in Qatar in 2022. Then there are the chances to bid for the 2026 World Cup \\u2013 and win.\\n\\nJapan already leads the world in robots and one-seeds in tennis, but there\\u2019s more:\\n\\nNot just tinpot. Japan\\u2019s bid to host the football World Cup was hailed as wonderfully simple at a time when other bids were elaborate and oddly coordinated. It won in a landslide and its chances of staging an excellent tournament are good to excellent.\\n\\nCross training. The Japanese men\\u2019s wheelchair basketball team have been training for the Paralympics for six years.\\n\\nComing through. The player with the most goals in Paralympic football is Yuta Nakashima, a 34-year-old with cerebral palsy who was persuaded to go to a training camp at 17.\\n\\nThat brings us back to the Olympics, and a lesson in how to make it in sports as a young person. \\\"My parents told me I could go [to the training camp],\\u201d Nakashima told the New York Times. \\\"So I went \\u2013 but only to watch. When I got there, the coaches persuaded me to play, saying \\u2018let\\u2019s give it a try\\u2019. I\\u2019m glad I listened.\\u201d\\n\\nThe camp was for potential Paralympic players. Nakashima went on to score a hat trick in his third tournament for Japan. This year he led the race for top goalscorer with 17 in six games.\\n\\nA note on the Japanese team in Doha: there are no quotas or extra funding for the country\\u2019s disabled players. They\\u2019re all athletes, period, picking themselves to represent the land of the rising sun. Nineteen-year-old Musashi Mizuno already has 10 Paralympic medals, while in the over-16s group the team includes a 72-year-old goalkeeper who used to play for Brazil.\\n\\nThe samba beat.

When the international affairs think tank Tortoise published its AI index last year, there was little reason to suppose it would become one of the most influential new assessments of global progress. But instead, the Global AI Index \\u2013 or Gaxi for short \\u2013 quickly became the Rosetta Stone for how to make sense of a staggeringly complex transition from human to digital intelligence.\\n\\n\\u201cWe thought we would be useful for ministers and heads of international organisations for whom we could summarise complex information about their countries in a simple ranking,\\u201d Tortoise\\u2019s founder and executive chairman, Francis Gurtraff, tells Tortoise Weekly.\\n\\nA year on, Tortoise\\u2019s Gaxi report is one of the fastest rising publications in history (#536, according to statistics website Semantic GM).\\n\\nFor context, 7 million books were published between 2010 and 2019. The most popular of all time \\u2013 The Lord of the Rings \\u2013 sold 250 million copies.\\n\\nIn that same period, more than 35,000 research papers and doctoral theses were published in China alone.\\n\\nIt's no surprise then that Gaxi has upended the global conversation about whether smart machines deliver progress by looking at what actually happens to people when smart systems are deployed in their lives. In other words: correlation, not causation.\\n\\nThe index provides a measure of how AI serves top-down (government) or bottom-up (business) goals at the national level and highlights\\n individual, developmental and cognitive impacts;\\n multi- and trans-sectoral linkages between AI and human decision-making;\\n capacity for strategies to adapt to change; and\\n \\u201cmoral\\u201d risks of entrusting decisions to machines (most notably, data bias and human jobs where human oversight is not possible).\\n\\nThe Gaxi formula works. Low scores correlate strongly with real-world problems, as Tortoise has found in subsequent research. Read on for more detail\"\n",

Vladislav Zlujev thought not when he hacked Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg\\u2019s account and posted images of him pulling down his trousers in front of colleagues and a nude selfie, with this text: \\u201cDouble standards\\u201d\\n\\nThe pictures have been deleted from Instagram, where Zuckerberg\\u2019s original post remained up \\u2013 but only after a delay of almost 24 hours in which the story was picked up across the world.\\n\\nThe backstory. Zlujev is a controversial Ukrainian opposition blogger. In a Facebook post not entirely in character, he said the hack was retaliation for Facebook\\u2019s alleged stripping and doctored images of a protest in Kyiv. Zuckerberg, he wrote, had the \\u201cprivilege of being described as the founder of a $1.7-trillion company and the boss who, according to the journalists, had an active role in censoring Ukrainian peaceful protesters\\u201d.\\n\\nQuestions.If Zlujev did indeed hack Zuckerberg\\u2019s account this was a neat and all-too-rare example of online meting out of online justice.If he didn\\u2019t, how did the images end up on Facebook? By what process \\u2013 human or algorithmic \\u2013 were they highlighted for approval or sharing by Zuckerberg, who at the time was travelling in China?And what happened to them before they were deleted? A Facebook spokesperson declined to answer most of the above but sent this statement: \\u201cWe investigated the hack and took down the photos. That account was also temporarily suspended and we emailed the legitimate owner.\\u201d\\n\\nResponses.The company\\u2019s mea culpa might have been more immediate but for the Chinese authorities\\u2019 preoccupation with the story. An insider says Facebook was \\u201cterrified\\u201d of Chinese authorities targeting its operations there. Some commentators resorted to satire (the writer Orli Matlow: \\u201cDon\\u2019t get me wrong, I\\u2019d totally let Mark Zuckerberg take a photo of me taking a photo of him taking a photo of himself taking a photo of himself\\u201d), but most were appalled. The former digital minister Matt Hancock called it a \\u201cnasty episode\\u201d and said he might reopen an old investigation into Facebook as a digital public space.
